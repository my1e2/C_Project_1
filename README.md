My program code allows two players to take turns cycling through the words/letters of a school supplies (hint for possible words) word bank.

They get 3 wrong word guesses until they have to get it right or they lose the ability to guess the word for that turn. Then it becomes the next player's turn, and each player will continue to guess words until there are no more words left to guess.

Each player has the option to guess what exact letters are in the word. The program will also tell you the occurrences of the letter that is inside the word they are checking for. However, it will not expose the position of that letter in the word.

Players also have the option of guessing the word whenever they want to after guessing a letter during their turn to go. 

Displays final cumulative score after each player is done guessing the words (a lower score is better, which means the player took fewer letter guesses).

The amount of letter guesses and word guesses is reset for the next player after the other player either guesses the word correctly, or guesses the word wrong 3 times.
